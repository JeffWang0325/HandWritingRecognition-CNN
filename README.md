# Convolutional Neural Networks

Learn how to create a convolutional neural network to recognize images of numbers using Keras.

## Getting Started

Download the files and run paintApp.py to test the model. If you want to redo the training process you can just delete the mnist_model.h5 and then run either paintApp.py or keras_cnn.py

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) install.  
As well as either [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html) as a backend for Keras.
